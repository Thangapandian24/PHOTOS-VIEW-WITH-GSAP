ðŸ“œ Project Details:

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

Description: I recently dived into the world of web animations and decided to challenge myself by building an elastic accordion effect from scratch using GSAP. The result is a visually appealing and interactive component that's perfect for enhancing user experiences on websites and applications.

Key Features:

Smooth and realistic elastic motion.
Accordion-style content expansion and contraction.
Customizable to fit various design styles and content types.
Smooth user interactions with event handling.
Cross-browser compatibility and responsive design.
Why GSAP? I chose GSAP for its versatility and ease of use when it comes to creating complex animations. GSAP provided the tools I needed to achieve the precise timing and motion curves required for this project.

Future Plans: I'm planning to further optimize and expand on this accordion animation. I'm also exploring ways to integrate it into real-world web projects to enhance user interfaces and provide a smoother user experience.
